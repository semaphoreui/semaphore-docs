# Settings

The Settings page allows you to configure various aspects of your project, including notifications, and project-specific settings. This page is accessible to project administrators and provides centralized management of project configuration.


## Runners (Pro)

Project runners can be attached to a project. You can also require a specific runner by tag in a template:

1. In `Project → Runners`, add a runner and specify a tag.
2. In `Project → Templates → <your template>`, set the required runner tag.

This ensures the task is executed on a runner matching the tag.
