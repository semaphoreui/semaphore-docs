# Getting Started

New to Semaphore UI? Start here to understand what the platform offers, set up a working environment in minutes, and learn the vocabulary used throughout the rest of the documentation.

## Who this guide is for

* **Evaluators** who want to try Semaphore in a lab or proof-of-concept.
* **System administrators** who are planning a production deployment.
* **Automation engineers** who will build and operate projects day-to-day.

Each subsection is written as a short, self-contained guide that links to deeper administration and user topics when you are ready to dive in.

## What you will learn

1. [Quick Start](./quickstart.md) – install Semaphore locally or with Docker and run your first task.
2. [Core Concepts](./concepts.md) – understand the primary building blocks (projects, task templates, inventories, secrets, runners).
3. [UI Tour](./ui-tour.md) – get oriented in the navigation, project dashboards, and execution views.
4. [Next Steps](./next-steps.md) – adopt Semaphore in a team: configure authentication, connect source control, and enforce process.

> Looking for scripted installs, advanced configuration, or scaling guidance? Skip to the [Administration Guide](../administration-guide/README.md). If you already have Semaphore and need help operating it, check the [User Guide](../user-guide/README.md).
